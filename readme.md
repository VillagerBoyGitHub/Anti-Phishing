Welcome to the anti-phishing website!

This website is basically a redirect to my main website using phishing website's DNS.

How this works:
Basically, a scammer makes a DNS record called "000000000.duckdns.org" pointing to their phishing website, and they get banned from the DNS service for phishing, so what I do is register that DNS record for myself, make this website which will redirect all traffic to my main one, and then I enjoy all the traffic by protecting users!
